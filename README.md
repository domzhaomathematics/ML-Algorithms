# ML-Algorithms
My first introduction to ML. These "projects" are part of my self-learning process, while auditing the EPFL introductory class on Machine Learning.Implementation (without external libraries other than numpy and pandas) of various machine learning algorithms such as PCA, Matrix Factorization, GMM, K-Means, Kernel Regression, Logistic Regression etc.
